//TOPIC #1: Variables. Below are a few different examples of variables. Note: variables begin with "var" followed by the actual variable, then the assignment operator and the value. Variables can only begin with a letter or an underscore. Also, javascript is case-sensitive so your browser will interpret "x" as being different than "X".

var a = 1

var x = 5346

var _numberofshoes = 15

var C = 82



//TOPIC #2: Debugging. Below are examples of alerts, comments, and printing to the console, using the variables defined in Topic #1.

console.log(a); 
//This will print 1 in the console.

console.log(a+x); 
//This will print 5347â€”the values of a and x added in the console.

console.log("x"); 
//This will print the letter "x". When you push something to the console in quotations, the console prints exactly what's in that string.

console.log(alert(_numberofshoes+a)); 
//This will cause the browser to open an alert dialogue box with the values of _numberofshoes and a added.

console.log(alert(x)); 
//This will cause the browser to open an alert dialogue with the value of x.
//This is a comment on a single line.
/*This is 
a comment on 
multiple lines.*/



//TOPIC #3: Different data types. Below are 4 different data types: strings, numbers, booleans, undefined.

"This is a string." 
//This is an example of a string. Values included in double quotations are treated as strings.

"String." 
//This is another example of a string.

4 
//This is an example of a number.

var m = 4 
//This is an example of a number defined by a variable.

true 
false
//These are the two booleans. It's an either or value type in which the script will only take the value true or the value false.

var h 
//This is an example of a data type that's undefined.



//TOPIC #4: Arrays. Below are examples of arrays. Arrays are basically a collection, or series, of strings.

var colors = ["yellow", "green", "blue", "red", "violet", "orange"];
//This is an example of an array that has six values. The values are assigned a number beginning at 0 which can be used in debugging and programming. See example below.

console.log(alert(colors[0]));
//In this example, the browser will pop up an alert that prints the word "yellow."

console.log(alert(colors[0] + colors[4]));
//In this example, the browser will pop up an alert that prints the word "yellow" followed by the word "violet."



//TOPIC #5: Testing. Testing allows the programmer to control the flow of scripts. In other words, the programmer can write a function that will only run if the test returns either true or false. 

4 < 10;
//This is an example of a test that will return a boolean value of true.

4 = 10;
//This is an example of a test that will return a boolean value of false.

"4" = "10"
//In this example, the test is comparing the strings against one another. It will return a boolean value of false.
